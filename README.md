# My Password Generator Application

## Overview
This project involved making a password generator application operational and user friendly so that users can generate random passwords based on specific criteria. The application runs in the browser and features a clean and responsive user interface. Users can select the length of the password and specify whether it should include uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.

## Motivation
The motivation behind this project is to provide a secure and easy-to-use tool for generating strong passwords. With an increase in brute force attacks, having a reliable password generator is essential for individuals and organizations to create robust passwords that enhance their digital security.

## Project Scope
The project involves building a password generator application that meets specific requirements, including length validation, character type selection, and error handling. The application should provide an intuitive user experience and generate passwords that adhere to the selected criteria.

## Key Features
- **Password Length Selection:** Users can specify the desired length of the generated password (between 8 and 128 characters).
- **Character Type Selection:** Users can choose to include uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters in the generated password.
- **Validation and Error Handling:** The application validates user inputs and ensures that at least one character type is selected. Error messages are displayed to guide users.
- **Responsive Design:** The user interface is designed to be responsive, adapting to various screen sizes and devices.
- **Copy to Clipboard:** The generated password can be easily copied to the clipboard for convenient use.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML:** Structuring the web page and creating user interface elements.
- **CSS:** Styling the user interface and ensuring a visually appealing design.
- **JavaScript:** Implementing the password generation logic, user input validation, and dynamic content updates.
- **GitHub:** Hosting the project repository and enabling version control.
- **GitHub Pages:** Deploying the application online for easy access.

## Future Enhancements
- **Password Strength Indicator:** Implement a feature to evaluate the strength of the generated password (weak, medium, strong) based on established criteria.
- **User Profiles:** Allow users to create profiles with specific password generation preferences and save their generated passwords securely.
- **Password History:** Implement a history feature that stores previously generated passwords for reference.
- **Integration with Password Managers:** Provide an option to export generated passwords to popular online password management tools and cold wallets
